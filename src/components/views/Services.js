This helps couples remember that their partner is a mystery; experiencing a subjective reality very much unlike their own. Together from this understanding, we facilitate an avenue to openness and curiosity where couples can begin to cultivate a lived-awareness that they are a team; that they can either be "right" or be "in-relationship."
