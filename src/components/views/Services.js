                              <p className="services__full-paragraph" />Individual Therapy is a collaborative and relational process of discovering a deeper understanding of oneself. Your therapist with Rose and Sooy will not only provide you with support for navigating life‚Äôs stressors, but will help you create a compass towards a life guided by your values. Self-discovery, self-help and self-talk can be great tools but can only go so far. Therapy can provide a more objective perspective from a kind, caring expert on psychology (that‚Äôs us!) to help you make sense of your subjective experience of reality.
                              <p className="services__full-paragraph" />We believe the outcome of therapy is most predicted by the relationship between the therapist and the client. We honor you as the expert on yourself; your truth, your desires and your goals. Individual therapy is a great place to explore yourself and refine your techniques for improving your life, reaching your goals and caring for yourself. This can help our clients build confidence to ask for what they need, from themselves and the world around them. Who couldn‚Äôt use a fresh perspective on how to be kind to yourself, resolve a conflict with a friend, or set a boundary with a family member? Individual therapy is like a dress rehearsal for life; you‚Äôre free to try out new techniques and see what works and what doesn‚Äôt, all from the comfort of a very low stakes therapy office. Or even from your own couch!
                              <p className="services__full-paragraph" />At Rose + Sooy Counseling, we integrate a variety of evidence based practices to provide holistic care, catered to each individual. We offer a safe space for you to express and feel your emotions and reconnect with your mind and body. Each session is approached with curiosity, non-judgment and a trauma-informed lens. We utilize Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to help you find acceptance for things outside of your control and take meaningful action on things you are capable of changing. We also employ a range of other evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to discover how unhelpful thinking styles may be convincing you to stay in old patterns of behavior that may have been protective in the past but are no longer serving you.
