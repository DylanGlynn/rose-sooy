                              I enter the therapeutic relationship with openness, curiosity, and a trauma-informed lens. I create a safe space for you to share your story; therefore, you can expect a warm, judgment free approach when meeting with me. I know from personal experience how vulnerable therapy can feel. As a therapist who goes to therapy herself, I understand how hard and scary it is but also how rewarding it is to heal and grow. You deserve to show up for yourself in this way too. I would be honored to hold space with you as you embark on this healing journey for yourself.

                              My approach to therapy is relational and collaborative, based upon the knowledge that you are the expert of your own experiences. I view myself as your guide to connecting with your body-mind-emotions. If you are looking to unpack negative or unhelpful beliefs instilled by trauma, heal from emotional exhaustion after prioritizing othersâ€™ needs before your own, or wanting to learn how to regulate your overactive nervous system to find inner peace; you're in the right place! With meaningful connection, collaboration and honest feedback, growth and change can happen. You can rediscover your inner healing and strength. Together, we will create a roadmap to living an authentic, self-compassionate, and balanced life that is aligned with your values. By integrating an eclectic approach, I individualize treatment uniquely to you; using a variety of evidence-based therapy models such as EMDR, Internal Family Systems (IFS), Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT), and Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT). I am LGBTQIA+ affirming, body positive, and incorporate skills such as mindfulness, somatic awareness, psychodynamic and feminist theories.

                              Being a therapist is my dream job and I am passionate about this work. I am the oldest of five children from an endearingly messy and blended family. I have called Nashville home since moving here in 2015 from Cleveland, Ohio. In my free time I enjoy spending time outdoors and can usually be found hiking somewhere with my spouse and our two energetic dogs. I am creative at heart and enjoy expressing myself through art and design. I have a love for learning and am a podcast/audiobook enthusiast.
