                              We are happy to provide you with a super bill for possible <em className="policies__fees-emphasis">out-of-network</em> reimbursement. Please be aware that in order for your insurance company to consider your claim for reimbursement, they require a mental health diagnosis from the DSM - 5 which could then become part of your permanent medical record.
