                              If you are unable to provide a 24 hour notice of your cancellation, you will be charged the full session fee. This is also the case for any missed appointments (no-show). Late cancellation and no show fee will be charged to the payment method saved on your Simple Practice account. Note that insurance companies do not reimburse for missed or late cancellation sessions.
